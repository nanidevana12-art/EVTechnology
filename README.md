⚡ EV Technology Evolution Website










🌍 Overview

EV Technology Evolution Website is an educational and interactive platform designed to showcase how Electric Vehicle technology is evolving — from early battery-powered vehicles to modern smart EV systems.
It uses animations, 3D visuals, and interactive sections to teach users about battery types, charging systems, and power management in an engaging way.

🚗 Features

⚡ EV Evolution Timeline: Animated display showing how EV technology has improved over the years.

🔋 Battery Animation: Interactive visuals showing how Li-ion and solid-state batteries store and release energy.

🧠 Learn Mode: Educational sections explaining EV components like motors, inverters, and charging infrastructure.

🌐 Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktop and mobile browsers.

🎨 Smooth Animations: Built with CSS keyframes and JavaScript for realistic energy flow effects.
